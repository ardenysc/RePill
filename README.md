# RePill

## Description

RePill is a medication tracker that allows you to add or remove medications and supplements to the list, as long as they can be counted individually. You can enter information about each pill, including a brief description, dosage, medication time, and how many you have left.

## Motivation

Many medications have fixed medication schedule you must adhere to, but it is very easy to miss especially when you have more than one medication to take on a daily basis. This applies to supplements as well since many of them are encouraged to be taken at certain time to maximize the effect. So, I aimed to build an application that helps you keep track of your million of pills and never miss a dose or unexpectedly run out of it.

## You can

- Add a pill to my collection of pills.
- Remove a pill from my collection of pills.
